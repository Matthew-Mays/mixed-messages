# Mixed Messages
## Summary
This program is designed to log a message to the console that calls a random story and then grabs random words from arrays to fill in blanks. It is a Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course off-platform project. I partnered with [Rick Mays](https://github.com/rickmays) for this project as it was the first partner project in the course. We were only given guidelines of the project, all of the code was written by us.

## - Project Goals
These are the project goals as outlined by Codecademy:  
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
- ### Create Script And Run It Locally
    - On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.
- ### Set Up Version Control
    - Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.
- ### Store Message Components
    - Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.
- ### Create The Message
    - Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so they can create a cohesive message.
- ### Put the Program Together
    - Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.
## The Experience
- The lessons leading up to this off-platform project were about JavaScript fundamentals through arrays, loops, and if/switch statements.
- Another aspect this project was testing was our ability to work cooporatively with Git/Github. We were expected to work in the same repository and create branches to write and test our code.
- As this wasn't the most technically challenging project we've encountered, the real challenge of the project was ensuring that we performed the correct steps in order to push/pull to the same repository.
- The project goals were given to us in a Kanban style, however since they could only be moved in their interface and not edited, we took it a step further. I developed a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/9eYXMvgB/mixed-messages) for our project and transferred the goals into its own category on the page. This way we could edit the board and add cards to better keep track of parts that needed completion.
